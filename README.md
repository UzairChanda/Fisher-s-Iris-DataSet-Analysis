# Fisher-s-Iris-DataSet-Analysis
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
In this projects various python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib are used to obtain the objective od Data Visualization and a clear perspective of Data Analysis on the mentioned Data Set. In this projects you will be able to notice the co-realation/proximity between the attributes of the data set through various graphs while creating this project I have also kept in mind Cairo's principles of truthfulness functionality beauty and insightfulness which is the base of this project.
